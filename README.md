##  About The Project

**HealthCare** is a full-stack web application built with **Django 5.2** that allows patients to book appointments, upload prescriptions securely, and manage their personal health records — all from a clean, modern interface.

What makes this project unique is its **role-based access control system**. Every user is assigned a role — `patient`, `doctor`, or `admin` — and the entire application dynamically adapts based on who is logged in. Doctors and admins get elevated privileges including a dedicated dashboard that shows all patient records, appointments, and prescriptions across the system.

Prescription files are stored **directly in the database as binary data** (`BinaryField`), meaning no filesystem or cloud storage setup is required — making the app easier to deploy and more secure.

---

##  Features

### For Patients
-  **Book Appointments** — Fill a quick form directly from the homepage
-  **Upload Prescriptions** — Drag & drop PDF upload, stored securely in the database
- **Private Records** — Can only view and download their own files
-  **Account Management** — Register, login, and logout with session-based auth

### For Doctors & Admins
-  **Elevated Access** — Automatically granted after logging in with doctor/admin role
-  **Full Dashboard** — Tabbed view of all patients, appointments, and prescriptions
-  **View All Records** — See every patient's prescriptions and appointment history
-  **Download Any File** — Download any prescription uploaded by any patient
-  **Live Search** — Filter through patients, appointments, and prescriptions in real-time
---

##  Role-Based Access System

This is the core feature of the application. Every user has one of three roles:

| Role | Access Level | Dashboard | See All Records | Upload Prescriptions |
|------|-------------|-----------|-----------------|----------------------|
| `patient` | Basic | ❌ | ❌ Own only | ✅ |
| `doctor` | Elevated | ✅ | ✅ All patients | ✅ |
| `admin` | Full | ✅ | ✅ All patients | ✅ |

### How it works step by step:

```
1. User registers → selects role (Patient / Doctor / Admin)
2. User logs in → role is saved into Django session
3. Every page checks the session role
4. UI adapts → Dashboard link shown only to Doctor/Admin
5. Data filtered → Patients see only their own records
6. Routes protected → /dashboard/ blocked for patients
```

##  Database Models

### `Users` Model
```python
class Users(models.Model):
    ROLE_CHOICES = [
        ('patient', 'Patient'),
        ('doctor', 'Doctor'),
        ('admin', 'Admin'),
    ]
    fullname  = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    username  = models.CharField(max_length=50, unique=True)
    email     = models.EmailField(unique=True)
    password  = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    role      = models.CharField(choices=ROLE_CHOICES, default='patient')
```

### `Prescription` Model — Binary File Storage
```python
class Prescription(models.Model):
    user              = models.ForeignKey(Users, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    patient_name      = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    doctor_name       = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    file_name         = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    file_data         = models.BinaryField()       # ← File stored in DB, not filesystem
    file_content_type = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    uploaded_at       = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```

> **Why BinaryField?** Storing files in the database means zero configuration for file storage. No AWS S3, no media folders, no extra setup. Just run and deploy.

### `Appointment` Model
```python
class Appointment(models.Model):
    user       = models.ForeignKey(Users, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    last_name  = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    email      = models.EmailField()
    phone      = models.CharField(max_length=15)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```

##  How the Admin System Works

### 1. Role stored in the database
When a user registers, their chosen role (`patient`, `doctor`, `admin`) is saved to the `Users` table.

### 2. Role saved to session on login
```python
request.session['role'] = user.role
```

### 3. Views protected with decorators
```python
@admin_or_doctor_required   # blocks patients entirely
def admin_dashboard(request):
    ...
```

### 4. Data filtered by role in views
```python
if user.is_admin_or_doctor:
    prescriptions = Prescription.objects.all()          # all records
else:
    prescriptions = Prescription.objects.filter(user=user)  # own records only
```

### 5. Download security check
```python
def download_prescription(request, pk):
    if not user.is_admin_or_doctor and prescription.user != user:
        raise Http404("File not found.")  # patient can't access others' files
```

### 6. Templates adapt to role
```django
{% if request.session.role == 'doctor' or request.session.role == 'admin' %}
    <a href="{% url 'dashboard' %}">Dashboard</a>
{% endif %}
```

## Security Features

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|---------------|
| **Route Protection** | Custom `@login_required_view` decorator |
| **Role Enforcement** | Custom `@admin_or_doctor_required` decorator |
| **File Ownership** | Download view checks `prescription.user == request_user` |
| **CSRF Protection** | Django's built-in `{% csrf_token %}` on all forms |
| **Session Auth** | Django session middleware — no JWT needed |
| **404 on Unauthorized** | Patients get `Http404` instead of `403` to avoid leaking info |
